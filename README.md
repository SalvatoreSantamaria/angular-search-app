# B2d

This is an angular search filter. It imports a JSON file and could be hooked up to an api. It takes in basic JSON data and is able to filter and display the results from an input search box. See https://youtu.be/r0tii4kyp2g for reference.

It is set up for bootstrap styling but needs bootstrap installed.
